# RetirementCalculator
This is a retirement calculator in Excel given different inputs
I am interested in knowing how much money I will have in retirement as well as when this money will run out. I realized that there are many inputs that change this amount. These inputs include retirement age, investment rate, rate of investment after retirement, contribution rate, withdrawal rate after retirement, and initial investment. 

I considered many questions in my anslysis such as what is the earliest age I could retire? What rate of return will be necessary to achieve retirement? How much can I leave in inheritance to my children? What is my life expetancy? will I run out of money in retirement?
